Run below code block to get the most recent notes from github.

To run a grey code block below, click anywhere inside it and then click the green play button in top left corner and click.

```{r echo = T, results = 'hide'}
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github('ddi-talent/usheR')

library(usheR)
update_from_github()
```
Once you run it, your R studio will install some packages and bring the most recent course notes from github to your R project.
