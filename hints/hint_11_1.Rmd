You'd say that for this scenario

True Positives (TP): 70 (correctly predicted positive examples)
False Positives (FP): 10 (incorrectly predicted positive examples)
False Negatives (FN): 20 (actual positive examples that were missed)
True Negatives (TN): 100 (correctly predicted negative examples)

```{r}
TP <- 70
FP <- 10
FN <- 20
TN <- 100

# and if you wondered how many guesses there were in total you could add all options
ALL <- TP + TN + FP + FN
ALL
```
